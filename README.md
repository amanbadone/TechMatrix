Theme : A better search engine for education

Students have to struggle a lot while they go through their studies and exams. We can save them valuable time by providing them with a way to get the desired output of the search made. With inspiration from different platforms like learnawesome.org , kidzsearch.com , kiddle.com , kidtopia.com , and scholar.google.com, we have an idea to build a platform to provide the most accurate possible search results specialized for student's search queries.
For this project, we will be using Programmable search engine resources from google itself to ensure we have the search results from the world's most accurate source that is Google

Also using it gives us the option to use the SafeSearch by google which clears out unnecessary and unexpected search results

So here is how it is planned to go,
  
1)we will create the front end with inspiration from kiddle.com but may add some extra category filters so as to enhance the search results 

  
2)We will then separately program search engines using the programmable search engine google for each specific category we will make 

and then finally
  
3)we will integrate this together that is the search bar in the front end and for each specification or filter you choose we have special search filters which help user to get the best output
